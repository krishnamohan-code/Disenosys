<p>Most of the times big companies demand 2+ years of experience in a particular field. An aspiring plastic-trim engineer should be focused to develop the above skills and take up internships in the related companies to build a strong resume. One who has worked on related projects and has some background knowledge of the work environment is always preferred for the job. The competition is tough but the requirement is only talent and hard work.

<p>Currently AllyGrow, Volvo group, Virtual Simutech, All Web Design, DailyCADCAM, APPL Global InfoTech, Smart Enovations like companies continued to hire plastic-trim engineers even after lockdown restrictions. There are 650 job openings in India as of now and once the industry is back in action, the workforce demand is likely to grow. And surprisingly abroad India, the number of vacancies is 2039. The numbers keep on changing but this clearly indicates all you need to have is a skill-set that you can tailor to the job requirements.
</p>
<p>With the wave of electrification of vehicles and retrofitting operations coming into full swing by the next year, design engineers will be a fish to catch.

<p>According to a report published on marketsandmarkets.com, “BEV manufacturers are working on reducing their overall weight, which is likely to enhance the range of the electric vehicle. To reduce the weight of the vehicle automotive OEMs are focusing on metal to plastic conversion and injection moulded plastic parts. Furthermore, OEMs are also focusing on strength and safety, and cost-effective plastics with high-temperature resistive property for battery compartment area. This trend is likely to create new opportunities for the plastic supplier, which are lighter in weight and comparatively less expensive than metal components.”

The major companies in this region are LG Chem, Asahi Kasei, Daikin, AGC, Sumitomo Chemical Company, and JSR Corporation. In terms of geography, the Asia region has the highest sales of electric vehicles. Henceforth, Asia is the largest as well as the fastest-growing electric vehicle plastics market.”
